Basic Network Sniffer on Python


Start with Python and Scapy - first install python and scrapy to your system. As i used VS code i did already have python installed in and i runned this command to make on "pip install scapy" before that you have to activare "VENU" omn the terminal of your work by running this code ".\venv\Scripts\activate" then install scrapy.

Then run the code for the network sniffer.

finally, i did run this code " python network_sniffer.py" through powershell by using this code ".\venv\Scripts\activate" at first and you may get the results of gettting the required ip address.
